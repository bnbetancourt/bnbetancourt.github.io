I am a Computer Science Student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2027

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab #4, part 1
  This was one of the first labs I truly enjoyed and learned a lot from hands-on experience with. This lab I was able to get hands-on experience using functions and learning the C++ file structure. This largely helped with my understanding of organizing and modularizing code, as well as this being the 4 lab where we get some good hands-on experience using makefile tools and slowly start to become comfortable with makefile commands. I really enjoyed being able to use what we learned in class and apply it to converting milliliters to various US units.

* Lab #10, part1 
  This lab is where I really started to understand the concept of 2D vectors, this is where we used the 2D vector to organize and search California county population data. We got a lot of hands-on experience here with using functions that interact with command-line input, and some hands-on experience converting strings to integers using the std::stoi().  I really started to understand the 2D vectors here where on some parts we needed just the county name and sometimes we needed only the population. This lab in itself provided an outstanding showing of hands-on experience regarding 2D vectors, makefile commands, and string conversion. 

* Lab #8, part 1 & 2
  This was one of the first labs where I fully felt confident in finally using vectors and functions. Since being confident in using vectors and functions, this lab consisted of a huge use of applying logical steps for a practical issue. This lab we use the functions in order to manipulate the data, in order ot create an input/output after using the command lines. Part 2 we use nested loops to generate a character pattern. This gave us some good hands-on experience using loop logic. This lab is where I also become way more comfortable with loops and using them in our implemented code.
